## 🎯 Project Vision

This platform addresses a common academic issue: how to find reliable, high-quality answers to technical questions. Instead of relying on open web searches full of spam, outdated answers, or malware risks, this system enables students to:

- Ask and answer questions
- Receive feedback from trusted reviewers
- Filter answers based on reviewer trust
- Improve answer quality through collaboration

It simulates a real-world multi-role environment and promotes collective learning through structured feedback loops.
